# Alpha-Five-in-a-row Zero
Summary: AI Playing Five-in-a-row, based on AlphaGo Zero algorithms.

## Five-in-a-row
It is a 2-person game played on checked paper. Player A puts an X into a square, then the Player B puts an O into a square and this goes on. The first one collecting five in a raw (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) will win. It is called go-moku if it is played on a go-like board. Its Hungarian name is Am≈ëba (Amoeba).

## AlphaGo & AlphaGo Zero
It is an AI algorithm which plays the Game of Go. It combines the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm with Deep Neural Networks. In its last version (AlphaGo Zero), it started with zero knowledge about the game (except for the rules), and it achieved super-human level just by playing itself (reinforcement learning).
